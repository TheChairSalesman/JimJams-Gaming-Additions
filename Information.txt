While i did include two unzipping files in this program, i would suggest to use WinRar Instead of 7 zip.
Most programs are meant to increase computer usability.
I DID NOT CREATE ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS.
I merely added them to this github address.
To use timer resolution, click max on the program and MINIMIZE.
Using the cpuparking, set all to 100%.
GoddardCore is nice
Ccleaner should be used often to clean up junk files.
All other files can be researched or experimented with.
